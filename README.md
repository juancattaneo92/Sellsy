## Built with

* Backend:
  - Ruby on Rails
  - PostgreSQL

* Frontend:
  - HTML & CSS
  - JavaScript 
  - React-Redux

## Key Features

* User Authorization:
  - Users can create an account, clicking at sign in button, then register.
  - Users can log in and log out anytime.
  - Developing this features was a challenge, using Ruby on Rails made it easier, by the fact that we practiced it for some weeks. 
  - The biggest challenge I believe was to connect the backend with the frontend, I was not 100% comfortable following the path of 
    React-Redux.
  - The best part for me was CSS, styling was fun. Once I understood more about it, I became faster and I knew what to expect.

* Products Page:
  - Users can browse around without needing to log in or create an account.
  - Users can look at the products, pictures, descriptions, and comments.
  - The biggest challenge was to upload pictures to Heroku, no doubt! 
  - Another challenge, I encountered was to make pop out the create comments feature.
  - And again, I can say that CSS was the part I invested most of my time, and I enjoyed the most.
